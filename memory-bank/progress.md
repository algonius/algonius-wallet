  - Official `mark3labs/mcp-go/client/sse.go` integration for reliable SSE client testing

### Previous Status (2025-06-23)

- MCP tool/resource registry pattern fully implemented in native/pkg/mcp/tools.go and resources.go, with all handlers (create_wallet, get_balance, send_transaction, confirm_transaction, get_transactions, sign_message, swap_tokens, wallet_status, supported_chains, supported_tokens) registered and mapped to modular business logic.
- Wallet module (native/pkg/wallet/) is now chain-agnostic, supporting multi-chain and multi-token operations via CreateWallet, GetBalance, and SendTransaction.
- **Real Ethereum wallet creation implemented**: Chain abstraction layer with IChain interface, EVMChain base class with secp256k1 key generation, ETHChain implementation, and ChainFactory for managing multiple chains. Wallets now generate actual Ethereum addresses with cryptographic key pairs.
- Robust logging and error handling in main.go and all service layers; logger fallback to stderr on init failure.
- Comprehensive unit tests for all MCP tool handlers (including edge/error cases) in tools_test.go.
- Integration tests for create wallet, get balance, send transaction, and supported chains resource in native/tests/integration/. Integration test for create_wallet MCP tool was debugged and fixed: result.Content is []mcp.TextContent (not pointer), so use type assertion to mcp.TextContent to extract the Text field for assertions.
- Project is in "core feature integration and refinement" phase. Native Host (Go) and Browser Extension (JS) main flows are implemented, E2E test plan is in place, now focusing on advanced features and automation per technical spec.
- **All code comments must be written in English. This is a strict team convention for all source files and documentation code blocks.**

## Completed Work

- Native Host logging system refactored: pkg/logger with zap, default log path $HOME/.algonius-wallet/logs/native-host.log, all comments in English.
- main.go uses the new logger for all output, with error fallback to stderr.
- Makefile adds run target for one-command execution: make run.

- Native Host (Go):
  - MCP Server, Wallet Manager, Native Messaging, Event Broadcaster modules implemented
  - Supports create_wallet, get_balance, send_transaction, sign_message, and other core interfaces
  - main.go implements handleCreateWallet, handleGetBalance, handleSignMessage, handleTransactionRequest, etc.
  - **All wallet import/export/backup operations are strictly handled via Native Messaging, never exposed to MCP tools.**
- Browser Extension (JS):
  - Background Service Worker (background/background.js: NativeHostConnection class)
  - Content Script (content/injected.js: Web3Provider injection, event listening)
  - Popup UI (popup/popup.js: wallet state, signals, connection status, settings, etc.)
  - MCPServer (src/modules/mcp/mcpServer.js) implements multiple handleXXX methods, covering wallet, transaction, market, and signal features
  - **All event flows between extension and Native Host now use Chrome Native Messaging (not SSE). Sensitive operations (wallet import, signing) are strictly UI-gated and never accessible to AI Agent or DApp.**
- Technical spec, detailed design, API, and E2E test docs are all up to date, forming a complete development loop
- Memory Bank mechanism is maintained, all core docs and progress are synchronized

## Known Issues

- Native Host multi-chain extension and event push require further refinement
- Browser Extension UI/UX details and chain switching functionality need completion
- Automated test scripts and CI integration are not yet fully implemented
- Some advanced security scenarios (multi-signature, hardware wallet, risk control) are pending

## Project Decisions Evolution

### Architecture & Security

- Strict separation of concerns: AI Agent can only access controlled MCP tools/resources, never overreaching its authority
- All sensitive operations (wallet import, private key export) are only allowed via Browser Extension UI, with Native Host local encrypted storage
- Event push uses SSE for AI Agent, but all extension communication uses Native Messaging for security and compatibility

### Technical Implementation

- Go/JS code is modular and interface-driven, supporting multi-chain extension and feature enhancement
- Error handling and logging must cover all flows for debugging and traceability
- UI/UX prioritizes security and clarity; all transactions require explicit user confirmation

## Team Practices & Conventions

- **MR Formatting**: Always ensure proper line breaks in MR descriptions. Use actual newlines (
) rather than escaped newlines (\
) when creating or updating MRs.
- **Code Comments**: All code comments must be written in English.
