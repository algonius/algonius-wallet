# Algonius Wallet Active Context

## Current Focus

### 2025-07-26 - Reject Transaction Tool Implementation

**üéØ MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT: GitHub Issue #13 - Reject Transaction MCP Tool**

- **Implemented reject_transaction MCP tool** solving GitHub issue #13
- **Comprehensive transaction rejection capabilities**:
  - Reject single or multiple pending transactions by ID
  - Standardized rejection reasons (suspicious_activity, high_gas_fee, user_request, security_concern, duplicate_transaction)
  - Optional user notifications and audit logging
  - Detailed reporting of success/failure for each transaction
- **Complete TransactionRejectionResult data structure** with all required fields:
  - Transaction hash, success status, error message
  - Rejection timestamp and audit log ID
- **Wallet manager integration** with RejectTransactions method
- **Audit logging** for all transaction rejections with traceable IDs
- **Unit and integration tests** covering all scenarios and edge cases
- **Registered in main.go** alongside other MCP tools

### 2025-07-17 - Get Pending Transactions Tool Implementation

**üéØ MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT: GitHub Issue #8 - Get Pending Transactions MCP Tool**

- **Implemented get_pending_transactions MCP tool** solving GitHub issue #8
- **Comprehensive filtering and pagination support**:
  - Filter by chain (ethereum, bsc, solana)
  - Filter by wallet address (from or to)
  - Filter by transaction type (transfer, swap, contract)
  - Pagination with limit (max 100) and offset parameters
- **Complete PendingTransaction data structure** with all required fields:
  - Transaction hash, chain, from/to addresses, amount, token

- **Wallet manager integration** with GetPendingTransactions method
- **Mock data for development** demonstrating various transaction states
- **Integration tests** covering all filtering scenarios and edge cases
- **Registered in main.go** alongside other MCP tools

### 2025-07-15 - Unified MCP Transport Layer Implementation

**üéØ MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT: Unified MCP Server with Multi-Transport Support**

- **Implemented unified MCP server architecture** solving GitHub issue #4 (SSE transport compatibility)
- **Dual transport protocol support**: 
  - `/mcp` - Streamable HTTP (existing clients, fully backward compatible)
  - `/mcp/sse` - Pure SSE transport (Cline and other SSE-only clients)
  - `/mcp/message` - SSE message endpoint for communication
- **Complete SSE client integration tests** using official `mark3labs/mcp-go/client/sse.go`
- **All tests passing** for both transport methods with identical functionality

### Previous Implementation (2025-06-22)

- Native Host (Go) MCP tool/resource registry pattern is fully implemented. All handlers (create_wallet, get_balance, send_transaction, confirm_transaction, get_transactions, sign_message, swap_tokens, wallet_status, supported_chains, supported_tokens) are registered and mapped to modular business logic.
- Wallet module is now chain-agnostic, supporting multi-chain and multi-token operations via CreateWallet, GetBalance, and SendTransaction.
- Logging and error handling are robust throughout the codebase; main.go uses a logger with fallback to stderr.
- Unit tests for all MCP tool handlers (including edge/error cases) are complete in tools_test.go.
- Integration tests for create wallet, get balance, send transaction, and supported chains resource are implemented in native/tests/integration/.
- All code comments are in English, per team convention.
- All sensitive wallet operations (import/export/backup) are strictly handled via Native Messaging, never exposed to MCP tools or AI Agent.
- All event flows between extension and Native Host use Chrome Native Messaging (not SSE).
- E2E test plan is in place; focus is shifting to advanced features, multi-chain support, E2E automation, and security enhancements.

## Recent Changes

### 2025-07-15 - Unified MCP Server Implementation

- **üöÄ Implemented Unified MCP Server Architecture**:
  - Created `setupUnifiedMCPServer()` function in `native/cmd/main.go`
  - Added dual transport protocol support using method 1 (independent endpoints)
  - Streamable HTTP server at `/mcp` for existing clients
  - SSE server with handlers at `/mcp/sse` and `/mcp/message` for SSE-only clients
  - Single HTTP server instance managing multiple transport protocols

- **üîÑ Refactored SSE Client Implementation**:
  - Replaced custom SSE client with official `mark3labs/mcp-go/client/sse.go`
  - Created `native/tests/integration/env/mcp_sse_client.go` as wrapper around official client
  - Simplified from ~300 lines of custom SSE handling to ~140 lines using official API
  - Better error handling, automatic reconnection, and standard MCP protocol compliance

- **‚úÖ Comprehensive SSE Integration Testing**:
  - Created `native/tests/integration/sse_transport_test.go` with complete test suite
  - `TestSSETransportEndpoints`: Tests both HTTP and SSE clients simultaneously
  - `TestSSETransportCompatibility`: Verifies identical results from both transports
  - `TestSSEEndpointDiscovery`: Tests SSE endpoint discovery mechanism
  - All tests passing, confirming full compatibility

- **üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements**:
  - Added `GetBaseURL()` method to test environment for SSE client initialization
  - Fixed SSE server configuration with correct base path and endpoint settings
  - Resolved status code expectations (SSE returns 200 OK, not 202 Accepted)
  - Implemented proper relative URL handling for message endpoints

### Previous Changes (2025-06-23 and earlier)

- Completed MCP tool/resource handler business logic and parameter validation.
- Expanded unit and integration test coverage for all handlers.
- Refactored wallet logic for modular, chain-agnostic support.
- Improved logging and error handling in all service layers.
- Debugged and fixed integration test for create_wallet MCP tool: Corrected extraction of text content from result.Content using type assertion to mcp.TextContent (not pointer). Ensured test asserts on actual returned values and logs type/value for future debugging.
- Updated Memory Bank documentation to reflect current architecture, constraints, and implementation patterns.
- **2025-06-23**: Migrated get_balance tool implementation to use new mcp-go v0.32.0 API:
  - Updated GetBalanceTool to implement proper GetMeta() and GetHandler() methods
  - Fixed WalletManager to implement IWalletManager interface with GetBalance method
  - Created integration test for get_balance tool
  - Registered get_balance tool in main.go
  - All tests passing, build successful
- **2025-06-23**: Implemented real Ethereum wallet creation with cryptographic key generation:
  - Created comprehensive chain abstraction layer with IChain interface
  - Implemented EVMChain base class with secp256k1 key generation using go-ethereum crypto
  - Created ETHChain specific implementation extending EVMChain
  - Implemented ChainFactory for managing multiple chain implementations
  - Updated WalletManager to use chain factory for real wallet creation
  - Generated wallets now produce actual Ethereum addresses with real private/public key pairs
  - Verified implementation: generates unique 42-character hex addresses starting with 0x
  - All integration tests passing with real wallet creation

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority (Post-Unified MCP Server)

- **üéØ GitHub Issue Resolution**: Mark GitHub issue #4 as completed with unified MCP server solution
- **üìö Documentation Updates**: Update API documentation to reflect dual transport endpoints
- **üß™ Extended Testing**: Add performance and load testing for concurrent HTTP/SSE clients
- **üîÑ CI/CD Integration**: Ensure all new tests are included in continuous integration

### Advanced Features Development

- Implement advanced features: multi-chain switching, SSE event push for AI Agent, security enhancements (multi-signature, hardware wallet, risk control).
- Continue E2E automation: Playwright/Puppeteer for DApp/UI, Go test for Native Host API, mock AI Agent for decision branches.
- Refine Browser Extension UI/UX: transaction history, chain switching, risk prompts, real-time status updates, user permissions.
- Maintain and expand test coverage for abnormal/security scenarios, regression, and data cleanup.
- Keep Memory Bank and documentation in sync with ongoing development.

## Key Considerations

- Strict separation of authority: AI Agent can only access controlled MCP tools/resources, never sensitive wallet operations.
- All sensitive operations are UI-gated and handled via Native Messaging.
- Security, extensibility, and clarity remain top priorities for all new features and refactors.
