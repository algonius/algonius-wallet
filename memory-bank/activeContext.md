  - `/mcp/message` - SSE message endpoint for communication
- **Complete SSE client integration tests** using official `mark3labs/mcp-go/client/sse.go`
- **All tests passing** for both transport methods with identical functionality

### Previous Implementation (2025-06-22)

- Native Host (Go) MCP tool/resource registry pattern is fully implemented. All handlers (create_wallet, get_balance, send_transaction, confirm_transaction, get_transactions, sign_message, swap_tokens, wallet_status, supported_chains, supported_tokens) are registered and mapped to modular business logic.
- Wallet module is now chain-agnostic, supporting multi-chain and multi-token operations via CreateWallet, GetBalance, and SendTransaction.
- Logging and error handling are robust throughout the codebase; main.go uses a logger with fallback to stderr.
- Unit tests for all MCP tool handlers (including edge/error cases) are complete in tools_test.go.
- Integration tests for create wallet, get balance, send transaction, and supported chains resource are implemented in native/tests/integration/.
- All code comments are in English, per team convention.
- All sensitive wallet operations (import/export/backup) are strictly handled via Native Messaging, never exposed to MCP tools or AI Agent.
- All event flows between extension and Native Host use Chrome Native Messaging (not SSE).
- E2E test plan is in place; focus is shifting to advanced features, multi-chain support, E2E automation, and security enhancements.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority (Implementation Phase)

- **üéØ Task Implementation**: Begin implementation of prioritized tasks from docs/issues/tasks.md
  - Implement missing MCP tools (sign_message, get_transaction_status)
  - Create transaction confirmation overlay in browser extension
  - Build comprehensive audit dashboard
- **üìö Documentation Updates**: Continue updating documentation as implementation progresses
- **üß™ Testing**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage for new features

### Advanced Features Development

- Implement advanced features: multi-chain switching, SSE event push for AI Agent, security enhancements (multi-signature, hardware wallet, risk control).
- Continue E2E automation: Playwright/Puppeteer for DApp/UI, Go test for Native Host API, mock AI Agent for decision branches.
- Refine Browser Extension UI/UX: transaction history, chain switching, risk prompts, real-time status updates, user permissions.
- Maintain and expand test coverage for abnormal/security scenarios, regression, and data cleanup.
- Keep Memory Bank and documentation in sync with ongoing development.

## Key Considerations

- Strict separation of authority: AI Agent can only access controlled MCP tools/resources, never sensitive wallet operations.
- All sensitive operations are UI-gated and handled via Native Messaging.
- Security, extensibility, and clarity remain top priorities for all new features and refactors.

## Team Practices & Conventions

- **MR Formatting**: Always ensure proper line breaks in MR descriptions. Use actual newlines (
) rather than escaped newlines (\
) when creating or updating MRs.
- **Code Comments**: All code comments must be in English.
