# Algonius Wallet Active Context

## Current Focus

### 2025-01-07

- **SSE (Server-Sent Events) implementation successfully completed** using mcp-go library's built-in SSE server functionality
- Native Host (Go) MCP tool/resource registry pattern is fully implemented. All handlers (create_wallet, get_balance, send_transaction, confirm_transaction, get_transactions, sign_message, swap_tokens, wallet_status, supported_chains, supported_tokens) are registered and mapped to modular business logic.
- Wallet module is now chain-agnostic, supporting multi-chain and multi-token operations via CreateWallet, GetBalance, and SendTransaction.
- Logging and error handling are robust throughout the codebase; main.go uses a logger with fallback to stderr.
- Unit tests for all MCP tool handlers (including edge/error cases) are complete in tools_test.go.
- Integration tests for create wallet, get balance, send transaction, and supported chains resource are implemented in native/tests/integration/.
- **SSE functionality fully tested** with comprehensive integration tests in sse_events_test.go
- All code comments are in English, per team convention.
- All sensitive wallet operations (import/export/backup) are strictly handled via Native Messaging, never exposed to MCP tools or AI Agent.
- **SSE events are now available for AI Agent real-time updates** while extension communication still uses Chrome Native Messaging for security.
- E2E test plan is in place; focus is shifting to advanced features, multi-chain support, E2E automation, and security enhancements.

## Recent Changes

- Completed MCP tool/resource handler business logic and parameter validation.
- Expanded unit and integration test coverage for all handlers.
- Refactored wallet logic for modular, chain-agnostic support.
- Improved logging and error handling in all service layers.
- Debugged and fixed integration test for create_wallet MCP tool: Corrected extraction of text content from result.Content using type assertion to mcp.TextContent (not pointer). Ensured test asserts on actual returned values and logs type/value for future debugging.
- Updated Memory Bank documentation to reflect current architecture, constraints, and implementation patterns.
- **2025-06-23**: Migrated get_balance tool implementation to use new mcp-go v0.32.0 API:
  - Updated GetBalanceTool to implement proper GetMeta() and GetHandler() methods
  - Fixed WalletManager to implement IWalletManager interface with GetBalance method
  - Created integration test for get_balance tool
  - Registered get_balance tool in main.go
  - All tests passing, build successful
- **2025-06-23**: Implemented real Ethereum wallet creation with cryptographic key generation:
  - Created comprehensive chain abstraction layer with IChain interface
  - Implemented EVMChain base class with secp256k1 key generation using go-ethereum crypto
  - Created ETHChain specific implementation extending EVMChain
  - Implemented ChainFactory for managing multiple chain implementations
  - Updated WalletManager to use chain factory for real wallet creation
  - Generated wallets now produce actual Ethereum addresses with real private/public key pairs
  - Verified implementation: generates unique 42-character hex addresses starting with 0x
  - All integration tests passing with real wallet creation
- **2025-01-07**: Completed SSE (Server-Sent Events) implementation:
  - Integrated mcp-go library's server.NewSSEServer() in main.go with MCP_SERVER_TYPE=sse configuration
  - Created thread-safe event broadcasting system (pkg/events/broadcaster.go) with session management
  - Implemented SSE events resource (pkg/mcp/resources/sse_events_resource.go) with event type documentation
  - Added comprehensive test suite (tests/integration/sse_events_test.go) covering broadcaster functionality, resource handlers, and event types
  - Created detailed implementation guide (docs/sse_implementation_guide.md) with client examples
  - Supports event types: transaction_confirmed, transaction_pending, transaction_failed, balance_changed, wallet_status_changed, block_new
  - All tests passing, SSE server starts successfully with environment configuration

## Next Steps

- Implement advanced features: multi-chain switching, security enhancements (multi-signature, hardware wallet, risk control).
- **Integrate SSE events with existing MCP tools** - add event broadcasting to send_transaction, confirm_transaction, and other wallet operations
- Continue E2E automation: Playwright/Puppeteer for DApp/UI, Go test for Native Host API, mock AI Agent for decision branches.
- Refine Browser Extension UI/UX: transaction history, chain switching, risk prompts, real-time status updates, user permissions.
- **Test SSE functionality with real AI Agent connections** and validate event streaming performance
- Maintain and expand test coverage for abnormal/security scenarios, regression, and data cleanup.
- Keep Memory Bank and documentation in sync with ongoing development.

## Key Considerations

- Strict separation of authority: AI Agent can only access controlled MCP tools/resources, never sensitive wallet operations.
- All sensitive operations are UI-gated and handled via Native Messaging.
- **SSE events provide real-time updates to AI Agent** while maintaining security boundaries - events are read-only and don't expose sensitive data.
- **Dual communication strategy**: SSE for AI Agent updates, Native Messaging for extension security.
- Security, extensibility, and clarity remain top priorities for all new features and refactors.
