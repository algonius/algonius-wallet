## Summary

Implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) resource to provide real-time blockchain and wallet events to AI Agents for reactive trading strategies.

## Background

AI trading agents need real-time data feeds to react quickly to market changes, transaction confirmations, and wallet events. SSE provides a standardized way to stream events without polling.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Stream real-time blockchain events (new blocks, transactions)
- [ ] Provide wallet-specific events (balance changes, incoming transactions)
- [ ] Support event filtering by type, address, and token
- [ ] Implement connection management and reconnection logic
- [ ] Add event history replay for missed events
- [ ] Support multiple concurrent event streams

### Technical Requirements

- [ ] Create `native/pkg/mcp/resources/events_resource.go`
- [ ] Implement SSE endpoint using Go's HTTP streaming
- [ ] Add event subscription management system
- [ ] Integrate with blockchain WebSocket APIs
- [ ] Implement event buffering and persistence
- [ ] Add connection health monitoring

### Event Types

- [ ] **Block Events**: New blocks, chain reorganizations
- [ ] **Transaction Events**: Confirmations, failures, pending status
- [ ] **Wallet Events**: Balance changes, incoming/outgoing transactions
- [ ] **Token Events**: Token transfers, approvals, swaps
- [ ] **Price Events**: Token price changes from oracles
- [ ] **System Events**: Wallet status, chain connectivity

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] SSE endpoint streams events in real-time
- [ ] Event filtering works correctly
- [ ] Connection recovery handles network issues
- [ ] Events are properly formatted and timestamped
- [ ] Integration tests pass with real blockchain events
- [ ] Performance supports multiple concurrent connections

## Implementation Details

### Files to Create/Modify

- `native/pkg/mcp/resources/events_resource.go` (new)
- `native/pkg/event/` (new package)
- `native/pkg/event/manager.go` (new)
- `native/pkg/event/types.go` (new)
- `native/pkg/event/filters.go` (new)
- `native/cmd/main.go` (register resource)

### SSE Resource URI

```
events://stream?filters=balance,transactions&address=0x...&chains=ethereum,bsc
```

### Event Format

```json
{
  "id": "event_12345",
  "type": "transaction_confirmed",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-24T07:00:00Z",
  "chain": "ethereum",
  "data": {
    "tx_hash": "0x...",
    "from": "0x...",
    "to": "0x...",
    "amount": "1000000000000000000",
    "token": "ETH",
    "confirmations": 6,
    "block_number": 18500000
  }
}
```

### Event Types

- `block_new`: New block detected
- `transaction_pending`: Transaction entered mempool
- `transaction_confirmed`: Transaction confirmed
- `transaction_failed`: Transaction failed
- `balance_changed`: Wallet balance updated
- `token_transfer`: Token transfer detected
- `price_update`: Token price changed

## Dependencies

- Requires WebSocket connections to blockchain nodes
- May need external price APIs (CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap)
- Related to existing wallet and chain interfaces

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests for event filtering and formatting
- [ ] Integration tests with real blockchain events
- [ ] Load tests for multiple concurrent connections
- [ ] Network failure recovery tests
- [ ] Event ordering and deduplication tests

## Performance Requirements

- [ ] Support 100+ concurrent SSE connections
- [ ] Event delivery latency under 1 second
- [ ] Memory usage under 100MB for event buffers
- [ ] Automatic cleanup of old events

## Configuration

- [ ] WebSocket endpoints for each blockchain
- [ ] Event buffer sizes and TTL
- [ ] Maximum concurrent connections
- [ ] Price update intervals
- [ ] Reconnection parameters

## Security Considerations

- [ ] Validate event subscription permissions
- [ ] Rate limit event stream connections
- [ ] Sanitize event data before streaming
- [ ] Prevent event data leakage between sessions

## Usage Example

```javascript
// AI Agent subscribing to wallet events
const eventSource = new EventSource(
  'http://localhost:8080/events/stream?filters=balance,transactions&address=0x123...'
);

eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if (data.type === 'balance_changed') {
    // React to balance change
    await rebalancePortfolio(data);
  }
};
```

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] WebSocket support for bidirectional communication
- [ ] Event persistence for offline agents
- [ ] Custom event filters with scripting
- [ ] Event aggregation and analytics
